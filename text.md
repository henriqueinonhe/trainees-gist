This document intends to guide you, a Presenter, on how to plan and drive your Presentation and the events during your Presentation week. Read carefully each section, and remember to follow the [checklist](#the-checklist) at the end, this [checklist](#the-checklist) will be used to check if we have everything in place to have the content presented to the Trainees 2 weeks before it takes place.

## The material and the content

The material used to give the presentation **must** include slides (Google Slides, Powerpoint or Keynote) so the Trainees will have a centralized place to see the content after it happens (besides the recording itself). The slides don't need to be complex or include a lot of text, but they should do the job of exposing the essential parts.

The content of each Presentation week should use the content of the previous weeks as a requirement. Take some time to talk to people that will Present a week before and after yours so you can arrange it better.

As part of the material, the Presenter should also include reliable links about the subjects that were mentioned so the Trainees can read more deeply about them.

## The presentation call

The presentation call should be guided using the slides as support and **must** include live coding. This live coding should show proper examples of how to (and, if possible, how _not to_) use the techniques and technologies that were shown during the presentation. As an example, you could start showing the slides and switch from the slide to small portions of live coding during each subject of the slides, but it is also acceptable to show all the content first and do the live coding at the end.

Take the first minutes of the presentation call to tell the Trainees who are you, how long have you been at Codeminer42, and your expertise, to create empathy. Also, make sure everybody is present and has their webcams on.

## Tests

The Presentation call does not need to touch the subject of how to test the technique presented, this is gonna be tackled in a separate call one day after the Presentation call.

## The challenge

Each presentation week includes a challenge, that will be solved by the Trainees and reviewed by their mentors during the week (we will talk more about review in the [next sections](#review-during-the-week)). The challenge should be progressively divided into tasks, following this template: https://gist.github.com/talyssonoc/9b63bf1ee9d7623af2038c11609e098e

The Presenter **must** solve the challenge themselves to check if the size and level of it match the available time, and provide the link for the solution to the Trainees at the end of the [review call](#the-review-call).

## Extra call during the week

For some content, it might be necessary to have a smaller, informal call during the week to tackle some specific subjects. This could happen directly in one of the Discord voice channels. If the presenter is not available for this call, they should point someone else to do it, **as long as this person is up-to-date about the subject of the week and does not suggest things that were not touched during the program yet**.

## Review during the week

The main reviews of the code produced by the Trainees will be done by their Mentors, but if the Presenter has the available time for it, they can review some of the PRs as well. The Mentors will keep in touch with the Presenter of the week to highlight what were the Trainee's main obstacles so the Presenter can address them during the [review call](#the-review-call).

## The review call

The presentation week ends with a review call. This review call is divided into three parts

1. The presenter shows their implementation of the challenge, including their rationale during the understanding of the problem, modeling of the solution, techniques and insights.
2. Each Trainee does a demo of the result of their work. This demo is of the **app**, not the code.
3. The presenter addresses the points raised by the Mentors and questions coming from the Trainees.

This call should **not** be used to review PRs or go through the whole code produced by any of the Trainees.

At the end of this call, you should prove the link for your solution to the challenge.

## Communication is key

If anything goes unexpected, let the Trainee program management know as soon as possible so we can react to it.

## Agenda of a presentation week

- Monday morning: [Presentation call](#the-presentation-call)
- Tuesday afternoon: [How to test the subject of the week](#tests)
- [Optional] Thursday: [Extra call](#extra-call-during-the-week)
- Friday afternoon: [Review call](#the-review-call)

## The checklist

- [ ] Does your presentation include slides?
- [ ] Do your slides tell the Trainees who you are?
- [ ] Did you include reliable links about the contents presented in the slides?
- [ ] Did you prepare some live coding?
- [ ] Does your challenge follow the template? https://gist.github.com/talyssonoc/9b63bf1ee9d7623af2038c11609e098e
- [ ] Did you solve the challenge yourself? Is it in Gitlab?
